This scatterplot shows the relationship between the average monthly income and the median monthly income. A line of regression runs through the points. All points on the line are color-coded uniquely, with points that stray farther from the line colored ever-darker shades of red. 

Note how the regression line has a slightly lesser slope than the diagonal since it skews toward higher values of average monthly income. Also note how profesional and doctorate degrees stray more from the line, indicating that they are more affected by high-income outliers.

Mean: 3370.85
Standard deviation: 2353.951
