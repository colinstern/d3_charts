As in table_2a, there is a clear correlation between education and income. However, there is less of a gap between the median income for professional degrees and doctorate degrees as there is between the average income. This could indicate that there are more outliers with professional degrees than with masters degrees. Also note how median income is lower than average income. This is likely due to high-income outliers.
