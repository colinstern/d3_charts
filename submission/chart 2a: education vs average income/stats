There is a clear correlation between income and higher degrees. Strangely, those whose highest level of education was a doctorate have less income than those with professional degrees. This could be due to the high salaries of doctors and lawyers who earn these professional degrees. It could also indicate that in the midst of the recession (2009) there was less demand for academics, and per supply-and-demand, their income decreased.
